        1) If the system context mentions a detected plant disease, prefer chat/rag, NOT web.
        2) Questions about the detected disease name, meaning, symptoms, treatment, or care => rag.
        3) Greetings or meta questions about the conversation => chat.
        4) Route to web ONLY for non-plant topics (e.g., human health, finance, weather).

        Answer with exactly one token: chat, rag, or web.
